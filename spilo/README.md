# spilo with vchord extension

This is a custom spilo image that includes the vchord Postgres extension. It can be used for instance with the photo app [immich](https://github.com/immich-app/immich).

An example PostgreSQL configuration that would work with immich can be found in this [discussion](https://github.com/immich-app/immich/discussions/20634).
